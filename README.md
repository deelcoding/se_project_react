# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

If you would like to download this code and run it for yourself on your computer, to get the items to render, you must run the command below in VSCode before running "npm run dev".

json-server --watch db.json --id _id --port 3001

## Sprint 10
